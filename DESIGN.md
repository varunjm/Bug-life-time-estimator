## Problem Statement
In the realm of Software engineering, one of the most time sensitive issues is fixing of bugs.
In code bases which are huge and being contributed to by many participants, there is a plethora of bugs being reported. Therefore one needs to prioritize the bugs in terms of its urgency and the time needed to solve a bug.
This is critical to rolling out updates that fix these bugs.


## Bot Description
To solve this problem, we would build a prediction model that would return the time estimate for a given bug report. This model would be created by using machine learning algorithms like Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes Classifier, Univariate and Multivariate regression, kNN, etc. We'll choose which model works best for this problem by experimenting with the accuracy of these models on test data. We will use online available datasets for training and testing purpose.

This updated model will then be used to predict the time it would take to fix a bug when user opens an issue on Github where he reports a bug. The bot would be a response to the event of creation of issue. The bot would comment a prediction of time on that issue. This would help the user plan which issue should be given preference and when to work on it. We would do this using Github WebHooks. This would be a ‘code bot’ as it would be responding to a Github event.

## Architecture Design

The bot follows the Event Systems Implicit Invocation Architecture.
We mainly have 3 components in the architecture -
The Prediction Model is a model created using machine learning algorithm to return an estimate of time depending on the bug. It would be generated before the deployment of the bot and would be static a static data structure that the bot will access when needed.

The Bot would work as the program that interacts with the user through the Github UI. It would use Github Webhooks to listen to the event of an Issue opening. It would then read the issue and use the Prediction Model to get the time estimate for the bug mentioned in the issue and print it as a comment in the issue.

The GitHut UI would display the Issue and comments and would serve as Front-End for the Bot and its functionalities.

Some constraints that would be established are that the bot would not be able to acces the actual code but only understand the bug from the issues generated by the user.

This bot program would follow the singleton pattern as there would be only one instance and provide only one point of access.
